## Core Components

### Router
The central navigation manager that handles all navigation requests and coordinates with the RouterDelegate to perform actual navigation operations.

### RouterDelegate
A protocol that defines the contract for handling navigation actions. This allows for easy testing and customization of navigation behavior.

### Destination
A protocol that represents a navigable destination in your app. Different types of destinations (Push, Sheet, FullScreen) implement this protocol.

### NavigationContainer
A SwiftUI view that sets up the navigation environment and provides the router instance to child views.

### NavigationButton
A reusable component that triggers navigation to a specific destination when tapped.
